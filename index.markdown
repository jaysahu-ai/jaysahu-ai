<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to my portfolio website! First of all, Thank You for checking this website out. I've put a lot of effort to develop this and even more love and care to maintain this. This website contains my projects which I've done independently in my free time to increase my learning of new age tools and technologies. Head over to <a href="https://jaysahu-ai.github.io/jaysahu-ai/projects/">Projects</a> section if you want to see my completed work.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I'm not immersing myself in developing new things, I work as a Business Analyst in Tech Mahindra for one of the major Oil & Gas organization located in Houston, Texas. I'm skilled in data and analystics tools and technologies like SQL, ETL, BIDW, Python and has knowledge of cloud technologies like Amazon Web Services & Micosoft Azure. I'm also a certified SAFe Agilist and Predictive Analystics developer. My major domain of work has been in Oil & Energy, Supply Chain Management, Railroads & Transportation; but I'm always eager to learn new things. If you want to know more about my career and professional experience please head over to <a href="https://jaysahu-ai.github.io/jaysahu-ai/resume/">Resume</a> section.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to learn and share new things in my free time. If you want to check out my posts, please head over to <a href="https://jaysahu-ai.github.io/jaysahu-ai/blogs/">Tech Blogs</a> section. Apart from all these I like to sketch and play tennis whenever I get some free time. Have any questions? Suggestions? or just want to grab a coffee?
